# GQL Changelog

The `C++` definition `GQL_VERSION` contains a 9+ digit code
representing the GQL version. The three least significant digits
are the patch version, the next three are the minor version, and
the remaining digits are the major version. For instance, the
code `000000003` is equivalent to `0.0.3` and the code
`123456001` is `123.456.1.`

## `0.0.3`
- Began changelog
- Added `in_degree` and `out_degree` queries
- Added `cli` integration test (this is also a functional
    interpretter w/ variables and queries)
